# WebRTC Mirror ðŸªž

WebRTC Mirror is a web application that allows you to see yourself as others see you and compare that image with your reflection in the mirror.

Small tool just 4 fun

## Description

**WebRTC Mirror** displays two video streams from your device's front camera:

1. **How people see you** â€” shows the image as others see you (non-mirrored).
2. **Your face in the mirror** â€” shows the image as you see yourself in a mirror (mirrored).

This application can be useful for those who want to get used to their appearance as others see it or simply prepare for meetings and video calls.
